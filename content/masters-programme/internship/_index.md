To fulfill the degree requirements, students are expected to complete a 450-hour internship. They should submit their internship proposal to the teaching committee for approval, a process that can be completed either in person, online, or a combination of both. The internship can be divided into different experiences, if needed. Relevant internship proposals could include AI applications in healthcare, at various institutions such as hospitals, healthcare authorities, software companies, and similar organizations. In addition to the practical experience, students are required to compose their thesis either during or upon completion of the internship.
