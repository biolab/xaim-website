The importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing worldwide. Its potential is also becoming more and more apparent with regard to the challenges in the healthcare sector.

It is therefore extremely important to address the lack of digital skills in this area by training qualified healthcare professionals in the field of AI and computer scientists in the field of healthcare.

**With our new master's program, we want to address this issue.**

### THE XAIM MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAM - AN OVERVIEW

Our xAIM online master's program aims to create an interdisciplinary environment where students are trained to work at the intersection of Data Science, AI and Healthcare. Students will learn the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Data Science so that they can handle and analyse large, heterogeneous and complex datasets representative of the healthcare sector. Concepts from the health sector are taught to further their understanding and to enable them to interpret the data and results. The entire program will put a strong focus on the current state of the art and possible future AI applications in healthcare, as an important goal of the master's program is to provide practical knowledge and the ability to apply the acquired skills. To complete the curriculum, there will be a strong emphasis on ethical and social implications of AI applications.

### ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS

One of the two following:
- Bachelor’s degree in Biology, Biomedicine, Life Sciences, Health Care or a closely related subject, alternatively graduation in medicine
- Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Management or a closely related subject

Additionally, each applicant has to provide evidence of:
- Knowledge of the English language at a level no lower than level B2 of the CEF (Common European Framework)

### COURSES AND TEACHING LANGUAGE

The master's program consists of three semesters, of which the first two include three compulsory courses each and a selection of electives. The third semester is dedicated to writing the master's thesis. The language of instruction is English. The individual courses are covered by the faculties of the participating universities.
