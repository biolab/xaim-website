name: "Giuseppe D'Ancona, MD, PhD"
occupation: "Chief of the Clinical Research Unit in Cardiovascular Disease, Senior Attending in Cardiology; Founder & Chair MAB, Neoolife, Inc."
location: "Berlin, Germany and Pittsburgh, PA, USA"
testimonial: "As a physician involved in clinical research, I know that AI and digitalization will be, and already are, the game changers in medicine. Resources to build necessary competencies in the field are still scarce, often unorganized, and primarily directed to a selectively technical audience. The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Management (xAIM) master is unique in its structure because it offers a series of exciting and innovative aspects, at different levels, for different professionals.
The Master's has been built using a multidisciplinary approach that includes more European academic entities and professionals with different backgrounds. The multidisciplinarity allows more aspects of AI/Digitalization/Management in healthcare.
