**On Thursday, May 26, 2022, at 16:00 CET, partners at the University of Ljubljana will organize a webinar for educators who either use or are interested in using [Orange Data Mining](https://orangedatamining.com) in data science training.**

**The webinar will feature a short demo on using Orange for training in machine learning.** They will showcase several data visualization and exploration widgets and show some tricks that one can use in the training sessions. They will present their GitHub repository with openly-available Orange training material. In the second half of the webinar, they will address selected questions from the audience submitted in the application form.
