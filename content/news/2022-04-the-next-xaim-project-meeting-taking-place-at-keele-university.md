***The next xAIM project meeting, hosted by Professor Ian CUMMING - Professor of Global Healthcare Workforce and Strategy- will take place at Keele University, Newcastle (Staffordshire), on the 7th and 8th July 2022.***

\
At the meeting project members will finalize the launch of the new Master Program on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Management.

\
The Master’s length will be 1 year and a half (2250 hours), and it will correspond to to 90 ECTS.

The Master’s degree will be awarded by the University of Pavia.

At the end of the Master, those students who have carried out all the activities and complied with the required obligations, after passing the final exam (defense of the thesis), will be awarded the 1st Level Master Degree in “eXplainable Artificial Intelligence in healthcare Management (xAIM)”.

*Background*

eXplainable Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Management is a new Interdisciplinary Master’s Program at the Intersection of AI and Health Care.

The consortium led by the University of Pavia receives funding from the European Commission program for “Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Telecom” designed to offer co-financing to stimulate and support the spread of European Digital Service Infrastructures (DSI) in various sectors, including the design and implementation of specialized master’s programs in Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The project’s objectives are:

* to establish a specific master’s program dedicated to the use of explainable AI in healthcare, in order to promote the development of highly qualified professionals to address the lack of highly specialized digital skills in AI;
* to develop a network of similar programs at European level, to progressively launch a joint master in “Digital Health Management”.

The project is coordinated by Professor Maria Chiara Demartini, co-coordinated by Professor Paola Cerchiello, while the coordination of the Scientific Committee is attributed to Professor Paolo Giudici. Professor Riccardo Bellazzi coordinates the Group of Experts of AI in Healthcare. Doctor Valentina Beretta is the Teaching Manager of the project.

The consortium is composed of the University of Pavia, Goethe University (D), Keele University (UK), Leibniz University Hannover (D) and University of Ljubljana (SL).

The overall grant is 1,664,557 euros.
