The project members will meet again, live, in Hannover. The meeting will be hosted by our colleagues at [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/en), and will take place on 25th and 26th of November, 2021. During the meeting, we will focus on discussions on the design and structure of the masters program in explainable AI that we are creating within our project.
